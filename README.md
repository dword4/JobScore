# JobScore

I have long found it annoying scrolling through job listings only to miss a weasel word like "other duties as assigned" or some mention of a clearance and then be halfway through some BS application process when it crops up
as a question and then you have already given them information of yours and wasted time filling out an application for a job you no longer have any interest in.  This is an effort to help with that process by letting you define
a list of keywords and then score a job posting based on that list to help filter out things you are not intersted in.

It should be noted this is very very basic right now, lacks things like persistence of keywords and anything resembling advanced configuration. In fact the list of things I would _like_ to add is probably longer than what it currently does.

## Roadmap
- [ ] actual useful documentation on how to install, etc
- [ ] configurable highlighting options (color, size, etc)
- [ ] keyword persistence
- [ ] ability to load keyword lists from text files
- [ ] have multiple lists saved, switch between them easily
- [ ] score-a-selection: some sites like Linkedin and Indeed cause issues with the extension, being able to select a block of text to score will help deal with this
- [ ] better way to display score (maybe a ribbon at the bottom a-la FoxClocks
- [ ] get included in Firefox extensions collection


### Super left-field long term Roadmap
- [ ] More advanced scoring (weights for certain words)
- [ ] Save-a-score: ability to save a score from a job to allow for historical data on jobs (finding trends in usage of key words)
