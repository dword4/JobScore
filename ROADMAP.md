## Roadmap

Here is a very loose idea of what I want to add/change/improve, subject to change at any time and zero expectations of timeframe for when it will get done.

- [x] actual useful documentation on how to install, etc
- [ ] configurable highlighting options (color, size, etc)
- [ ] keyword persistence
- [x] ability to load keyword lists from text files
- [x] have multiple lists saved, switch between them easily
- [ ] score-a-selection: some sites like Linkedin and Indeed cause issues with the extension, being able to select a block of text to score will help deal with this
- [ ] better way to display score (maybe a ribbon at the bottom a-la FoxClocks
- [ ] get included in Firefox extensions collection

### Super left-field long term Roadmap

- [ ] More advanced scoring (weights for certain words)
- [ ] Save-a-score: ability to save a score from a job to allow for historical data on jobs (finding trends in usage of key words)
